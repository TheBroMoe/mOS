# Description:
This was a fun personal Project based on following the tutorial by [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). I took on the task of trying to create my own OS to get more comfortable with low level computing, and fully grasp the concepts I was taught in my Operating Systems class.

This is an ongoing project still in the early stages of completion (Cross compilers are scary)

## Currently Implemented:
* Created boot sector
* Can enter in 32-bit mode

## Features to add:
* Kernel
* Video Driver
* Shell
* Interrupts
* memory allocation
