# Description:
This was a fun personal Project based on reading the OS-Dev [Document](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) by Nick Blundell, as well as referring to the tutorial by [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). I took on the task of trying to create my own OS to get more comfortable with low level computing, and fully grasp the concepts I was taught in my Operating Systems course.

This is an ongoing project that can be replicated and tested. I will eventually provide a guide on how to do so, but stay tuned!

## Currently Implemented:
* Created boot sector
* Can enter in 32-bit mode
* Kernel

## Features to add:
* Video Driver
* Shell
* Interrupts
